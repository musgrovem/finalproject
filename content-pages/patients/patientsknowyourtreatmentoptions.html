<p>Because you play a critical role in how well treatment works for you, you need to learn all you can about your disease and the available treatments for it. This overview of treatment options for aplastic anemia, MDS and PNH will get you started and direct you to where you can learn more.<p>

<p>Bone marrow failure diseases are complex. The more you know, the better equipped you are to  make informed choices about your care. It is important to stay curious about what you are reading and what your doctor is telling you. Ask questions about anything that confuses you. Stay up-to-date on progress in the field. AAMDSIF has many online resources that can help you. Below is an introduction to treatment options available for bone marrow failure diseases, with links to learn more.</p>

<h3>Caring for Yourself</h3>
<p>We help you cope with your battle against bone marrow failure disease. Much of the information we provide teaches patients and familes how to be proactive members of their health care team. Patients just like you have also learned how to develop their inner strength by connecting with our community and taking advantage of our resources.</p>
<h3>Therapies</h3>
	<h4>Androgens</h4>
<p>Androgens are natural male hormones that can cause your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. This can improve anemia. Androgens are sometimes used to treat aplastic anemia and PNH.</p> 
	<h4>Blood Clot Therapy</h4>
	<p>Blood clots are very dangerous. If you have a blood clot, you need to get help right away. Patients with PNH are at an increased risk of getting serious blood clots. Here are some ways blood clots are treated.</p>
	<h4>Blood Transfusions</h4>
	<p>A blood transfusion is a safe and common procedure. Most people who have a bone marrow failure disease like aplastic anemia, MDS or PNH will receive at least one blood transfusion. When you receive a blood transfusion, parts of blood from a donor are put into your bloodstream. This can help some patients with low blood counts.</p>
	<h4>Chemotherapy</h4>
	<p>If you have MDS and have a high-risk or intermediate-2 risk IPSS score, you have a higher risk of developing Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). To prevent this from happening, your doctor may prescribe intensive chemotherapy in order to kill bone marrow cells that have an abnormal size, shape, or look.</p>
	<h4>Eculizumab</h4>
	<p>Eculizumab (Soliris ®) is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) to treat PNH. It works by making your complement system less active.</p> 
	<h4>Growth Factors</h4>
	<p>Growth factors are naturally occurring hormones in your body that signal your bone marrow to make more of certain types of blood cells. Man-made growth factors may be given to some people with bone marrow failure diseases to help increase red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet counts.</p>
	<h4>Immunosuppressive Therapy</h4>
	<p>Immunosuppressive drug therapy lowers your body's immune response. This prevents your immune system from attacking your bone marrow, allowing bone marrow stem cells to grow which raises blood counts.</p>
	<h4>Iron Chelation</h4>
	<p>Iron chelation therapy is the main treatment used when you have a condition called iron overload. Iron overload means you have too much iron in your body. This can be a problem for people who get lots of red blood cell transfusions.</p>
	<h4>MDS Drug Therapy<h4>
	<p>There are three medicines approved in the U.S. to treat MDS. Azacitidine (Vidaza®) and decitabine (Dacogen®) are approved to treat both low- and high-risk patients with all sub-types of MDS. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is approved for transfusion-dependent MDS patients with isolated del(5q) and with a low or intermediate-1 risk IPSS score.</p>
	<h4>MDS Drug Therapy</h4>
	<p>There are three medicines approved in the U.S. to treat MDS. Azacitidine (Vidaza®) and decitabine (Dacogen®) are approved to treat both low- and high-risk patients with all sub-types of MDS. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is approved for transfusion-dependent MDS patients with isolated del(5q) and with a low or intermediate-1 risk IPSS score.</p>
	<h4>Bone Marrow Transplant</h4>
	<p>A bone marrow transplant (BMT) is also called a stem cell transplant (SCT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).The procedure replaces unhealthy blood-forming stem cells with healthy ones and offers some patients the possibility of a cure. But for many patients, a BMT is not an option due to the risks and potential long-term side effects as an "imperfect cure".</p>
	<h4>Clinical Trials</h4>
	<p>Clinical research is at the heart of all medical advances, identifying new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease. If you have a bone marrow failure disease, you may want to consider taking part in a clinical trial, also called a research study.</p>
