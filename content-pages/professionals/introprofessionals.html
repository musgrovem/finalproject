Health care professionals need their resources too. We offer them regional and online seminars on the latest developments in bone marrow failure treatments, as well as opportunities for continuing medical education. AAMDSIF also funds clinical research to find new treatments and to discover the cures.

<h4>MDS Clinical Research Consortium</h4>

<p>AAMDSIF is the administrator of the MDS Clinical Research Consortium (MDS CRC), a unique collaboration of six leading medical institutions designed to maximize the results of their individual MDS clinical trials. By sharing and comparing data, the group is able to enhance treatments and improve the lives of MDS patients nationwide.</p>

<h4>Professional Meetings</h4>

<p>We organize periodic world-class scientific meetings supported by the National Institutes of Health where leading researchers and medical experts share their findings and explore new treatment theories. We also hold smaller regional meetings to educate health professionals closer to home. And to help keep all professionals abreast of the latest news in treatment and diagnosis, we frequently offer webinars that conveniently earn them credit for continuing medical education requirements.</p>

<h4><a href="professionalsfundyourresearch.html">Fund Your Research></a></h4>

<p>AAMDSIF has funded researchers for over 24 years, awarding nearly $4 million in clinical research grants. With our financial support, their work has contributed to a greater understanding of bone marrow failure disease. This has led to the development of new treatments, as the search for the cures for aplastic anemia, MDS and PNH continues.</p>
