<p>AAMDSIF has funded researchers for over 24 years, awarding nearly $4 million in clinical research grants. With our financial support, their work has contributed to a greater understanding of bone marrow failure disease. This has led to the development of new treatments, as the search for the cures for aplastic anemia, MDS and PNH continues.</p>
 
<p>Each year, AAMDSIF invites researchers to apply for two-year grants of $30,000 per year to test new ideas and to explore other research leads. The applications are ranked according to merit by a distinguished panel of research scientists. Both established investigators and new investigators in bone marrow disease can apply for these awards. Second-year funding is contingent upon progress in the first year. 
AAMDSIF research grants are made possible by the generous contributions of patients, families and friends.</p>
