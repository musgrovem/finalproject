<p>As the primary source of information for patients, health care providers need factual, convenient resources to communicate effectively. Our digital and print educational tools are easily accessible and designed to enhance patients’ understanding of their disease, their prognosis and their treatment goals.</p>

<h2>Treating MDS Toolkit</h2>
<p>This resource provides health professionals with materials to help educate and support MDS patients and their caregivers. Contents include a patient counseling guide, individual patient information sheets and additional resources designed to enhance communication between the health care team and MDS patients.</p>
<p>AAMDSIF presents the Treating MDS Toolkit with free resources for health care providers to communicate with and support patients with MDS. Toolkit contents were developed with study data from two survey research projects conducted by AAMDSIF in recent years. Patients identified educational needs and preferences, which we used to develop this toolkit for use by professionals with their patients. Both of these studies showed that improved communications between MDS patients and their health care team may increase understanding of the disease and achieve better treatment outcomes.</p>

What the patient may be understanding vs. What you may be telling them

Upon hearing a diagnosis of MDS for the first time, patients may not immediately comprehend what the disease is, their prognosis or their treatment options. They likely have never heard of the disease prior to their diagnosis and do not know anyone who has had MDS. This can be an overwhelming and confusing time for patients and families.
With each visit, information will need to be repeated and reinforced to the patient and/or a caregiver who is accompanying them. It is often helpful to offer information in a variety of ways – one-on-one discussion, print materials, visuals, video presentations and recommendations for reliable websites.
Clear presentation of information and active engagement of patients in the management of their disease can help clarify misperceptions and improve patient understanding of MDS.
The toolkit includes the following resources:
	Summary of the patient survey
	Counseling guide
	Diagnostic Spectrum of MDS, MDS/MPN and MF Reference Card
	Patient information sheets
	Samples of AAMDSIF patient booklets and an order form for additional free booklets
