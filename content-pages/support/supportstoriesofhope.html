	<strong><a href="#">Kaitlin Placeholder: Aplastic Anemia Gives Her a Perspective on Life, and a Career Direction</a></strong>

	<p>It was August 2011, two days into the fall semester of my junior year of college at Penn State. I was excited to be surrounded by friends as we ran a booth for the fall involvement fair when I got a phone call from a nurse at my primary care doctor’s office with a concerned voice on the other end. I quickly tried to weave my way out of the crowd to a quieter environment when I heard the woman say “are you bleeding right now?!” How does one respond to that kind of question? I replied, “No. And...</p>

	<p>My professional career for thirty years was with Colonial Williamsburg.  I led children, adults, and even a king and queen on tours to explore our colonial history.

	<p>My husband, Rick, and I knew Jake was not feeling well. He kept denying it and saying he was fine. A bloody nose scared me and then I remembered my brother-in-law had them as a child and thought it was hereditary. Then his high school said he had another. He began to ask us if he looked pale. We said that he did. He also was coughing and seemed lethargic. We encouraged him to go to the doctor. He said he was fine. I begged him to tell me what was wrong. It must have been divine intervention,...</p>

	<p>My name is Dylan Martin. I am 24-years old and I was diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or, at the age of 17. It is familial MDS - the cancer runs in my family. When my mother, Leigh Ann, was first diagnosed, doctors told her she would never have to worry about my brother and I having it. Unfortunately, the doctors were incorrect. When my brother, Patrick, was 19, he was also diagnosed. About a year and a half ago my grandmother, Mary, found out that she had MDS.  According to the...</p>
