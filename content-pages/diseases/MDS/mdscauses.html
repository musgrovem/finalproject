title: MDS: Causes
---

<body>
 
<p>Doctors can’t identify a specific cause in 9 out of 10 MDS cases. These are called “de novo” MDS, meaning arising without a known cause. The remaining MDS cases result from treatment given for another cancer. Doctors call this Treatment-Related MDS, t-MDS or Secondary MDS.</p>

<h2>De Novo MDS</h2>
<p>The cause of most MDS cases is unknown. Doctors refer to this as de novo MDS. Two known factors can increase the likelihood of getting de novo MDS:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>People who smoke</li>
		<li>People who have been heavily exposed to certain chemicals, such as benzene</p>

<p>De novo MDS cannot be passed down through genes from parent to child or transmitted from person to person.</p>
<p>While anyone can get de novo MDS, you are more likely to be diagnosed with de novo MDS if you are:</P>  
	<ul>	
		<li>Male</li>
		<li>White</li>
		<li>Age 60 or older (average diagnosis age is 71)</li>

<h2>Treatment-related MDS</h2>

<p>About 1 out of 10 people with MDS developed it due to treatments they had for other cancers. This is called treatment-related MDS (t-MDS). This form of MDS can be severe and harder to treat than de novo MDS. You may also hear doctors call this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Therapy-related MDS</li>
		<li>Secondary MDS</li>

<p>On average, treatment-related MDS happens 5 to 7 years following treatment for other cancers. Overall, the chance of developing MDS as a result of another cancer treatment is very low. Less than 1 in 100 people treated for other cancers develop MDS. The risk increases for patients who have had multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy or have had a bone marrow transplant.
Cancer patients at higher risk for developing MDS may include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Women treated for breast cancer</li>
		<li>People treated for other blood or bone marrow disorders such as lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia</li>
		<li>People treated for head and neck cancers, gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancers, and possibly men treated for prostate cancer.</li>
