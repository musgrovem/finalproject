<h1>Types</h1> 

<p>MDS classification systems divide MDS into subtypes based on the results of blood and bone marrow tests. Scoring systems such as IPSS and IPSS-R have been developed to determine the severity of the MDS, probable survival term, and the risk of MDS developing into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p>
 
<h3>French American British (FAB) Classification System</h3>
The FAB system divides MDS in to five subtypes based on percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood. It is now used less frequently than the WHO classification, but is included here as a reference.
FAB-type	% blasts in blood	% blasts in bone marrow
RA (Refractory Anemia)
< 1	< 5
RARS (Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts	< 1	< 5
RAEB (Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts in Transmission) Note: Now called AML (acute myelogenous leukemia)
< 5	5 - 20
RAEB-t (Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts in Transformation)	> 5	21 - 30
CMML (chronic myelomonocytic Leukemia)	> 5	5 - 20
WHO (World Health Organization) Classification System
The WHO classification system builds and expands on the older FAB system. It divides MDS into eight subtypes based on tests of the blood and bone marrow. These eight subtypes include:
MDS Subtype	Blood Findings	Bone Marrow Findings
RCUD (Refractory Cytopenia with Unilineage Dysplasia)
Note:

<p>Considered the mildest category. MDS is limited to one cell line. There is little dysplasia.	It has 3 subtypes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>RA (Refractory Anemia) – Low red blood cell count that can’t be treated with iron or vitamins</li>
		<li>RN (Refractory Neutropenia) – Low white cell count</li>
		<li>RT (Refractory Thrombocytopenia) – Low platelet count
Less than 5 percent young blood cells (blasts) – applies to RA, RN and RT</li>
		<li>Red cell dysplasia (cells with an abnormal size, shape, or look)</li>
		<li>White cell dysplasia</li>
		<li>Megakaryocyte dysplasia</li>

RARS (Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, pronounced SID-uh-ruh-blasts)	 	<p>In RARS, more than 15 percent red blood cells that contain ring-shaped iron deposits (ring sideroblasts)
RCMD (Refractory Cytopenia with Multilineage Dysplasia)	Low white blood cell count (neutropenia) or low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)	Dysplasia in more than 1 cell type

Less than 5% blasts, or less than 15% ringed sideroblasts

Note: In patients with more than 15% ringed sideroblasts, the subtype is called RCMD_RS
RAEB-1 (Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts)	The same as refractory anemia	5% tp 9% blasts in marrow

Normal number of blasts in blood
RAEB-2 (Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts 2)	Similar to  refractory anemia	10% to 19% blasts in marrow
May have blasts in blood
Isolated Del 5q (Deletion 5q)	The same as refractory anemia, plus normal or high platelet count	Deletion of chromosome 5q, with no other chromosome abnormality
Note: More common in women age 65 and older who have mild to moderate degrees of anemia, low white blood cell counts, and normal to high platelet counts; life expectancy of more than five years from time of diagnosis
RCC (Refractory cytopenia in childhood)	Often more than one low blood count.	Bone marrow is often empty of cells (hypocellular)
This is rare
Unclassified MDS	Low count for wither platelets or white blood cells	Unusual features, such as scarring (fibrosis) of the bone marrow

Note: Just 1% to 2% of MDS patients have this subtype
International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)
<p>The IPSS gives each patient a score to help their doctor understand how quickly their MDS is progressing and what is likely to happen to their disease over time. Both IPSS and IPSS-R were developed from patient data obtained prior to treatment. Survival terms may be extended for patients who are undergoing treatment. The IPSS score assigns patients a score based on three factors:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>cytogenetics (changes in cell DNA)</li>
		<li>cytopenias (low blood cell counts)</li>
		<li>the percentage of blasts (immature cells in blood and bone marrow)</li>
