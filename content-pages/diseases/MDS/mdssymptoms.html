<p>The symptoms of MDS vary from person to person. Specific symptoms depend on which of your blood cell types are affected and how low your blood counts have fallen.</p>

	<h3>Low Red Blood Cell Counts</h3>
	<p>A low red blood cell count is called anemia. If you have a low red blood cell count, you may:
		<uL>
	<li>Feel a little tired or very tired</li>
	<li>Feel less alert or have trouble concentrating</li>
	<li>Have a loss of appetite or lose weight</li>
	<li>Have paler-than-normal skin</li>
	<li>Have trouble breathing</li>
	<li>Have rapid heartbeat</li>
	<li>Have difficulty exercising or climbing stairs</li>

	<p>Anemia is often the first symptom that a person with MDS develops. It is what usually alerts the doctor that something may be wrong. In the early stages of MDS, a person may have very mild symptoms or none at all. As red cell counts go lower, more symptoms develop.</p>

	<h3>Low White Blood Cell Counts</h3>
	<p>A low white blood cell count is called neutropenia. If you have a low white blood cell count, you may:</p>
	<ul>	
	<li>Have repeated fevers and infections</li>
	<li>Get bladder infections that make it painful to urinate or make you urinate more often</li>
	<li>Get lung infections that cause coughing and difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>Get mouth sores</li>
	<li>Get sinus infections and a stuffy nose</li>
	<li>Get skin infections</li>
	</ul>

<p> general, a low white cell count lowers an MDS patient’s ability to fight bacterial infections. A fever often accompanies these infections and may be a first sign that there is a problem.</p>
	<h3>Low Platelet Counts</h3>
	<p>A low platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. If you have a low platelet count, you may:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Bruise or bleed more easily, even from minor scrapes and bumps
	<li>Get heavier than normal menstrual periods
	<li>Get nose bleeds
	<li>Get tiny, flat red spots under your skin (petechiae) caused by bleeding
	<li>Have bleeding gums, especially after dental work or from brushing your teeth.
	</ul>	
<p>If platelet counts are not too low, there may be no obvious symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets can get so low that dangerous internal bleeding occurs.</p>
<p>Bleeding that will not stop is a medical emergency. An MDS patient needs to seek immediate medical help if they have bleeding that can’t be stopped by usual methods, such as applying pressure to the area.</p>
