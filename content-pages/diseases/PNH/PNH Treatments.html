Treatments 
PNH is considered chronic. That means it lasts for a long time. The only known cure is a bone marrow transplant. Other treatments are designed to ease symptoms and prevent problems. A small number of people say their PNH went away on its own over time. 
 
Therapies
Androgens
Androgens are natural male hormones that can cause your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. This can improve anemia. Androgens are sometimes used to treat aplastic anemia and PNH. 
Blood Transfusions
A blood transfusion is a safe and common procedure. Most people who have a bone marrow failure disease like aplastic anemia, MDS or PNH will receive at least one blood transfusion. When you receive a blood transfusion, parts of blood from a donor are put into your bloodstream. This can help some patients with low blood counts. 
Folic Acid
Folic acid, also called folate or vitamin B-12, is found in fresh or lightly cooked green vegetables. It helps your bone marrow make normal blood cells. When your bone marrow has to make more cells, it needs a larger supply of folic acid.
Most people get enough folate in their diet. But if you have PNH, it's a good idea to take 1 mg each day of a man-made form of folate called folic acid.
Growth Factors
Growth factors are naturally occurring hormones in your body that signal your bone marrow to make more of certain types of blood cells. Man-made growth factors may be given to some people with bone marrow failure diseases to help increase red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet counts.
Iron Chelation
Iron chelation therapy is the main treatment used when you have a condition called iron overload. Iron overload means you have too much iron in your body. This can be a problem for people who get lots of red blood cell transfusions.
MDS Drug Therapy
There are three medicines approved in the U.S. to treat MDS. Azacitidine (Vidaza®) and decitabine (Dacogen®) are approved to treat both low- and high-risk patients with all sub-types of MDS. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is approved for transfusion-dependent MDS patients with isolated del(5q) and with a low or intermediate-1 risk IPSS score.
Bone Marrow Transplant
A bone marrow transplant (BMT) is also called a stem cell transplant (SCT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).The procedure replaces unhealthy blood-forming stem cells with healthy ones and offers some patients the possibility of a cure. But for many patients, a BMT is not an option due to the risks and potential long-term side effects as an "imperfect cure".
Clinical Trials
Clinical research is at the heart of all medical advances, identifying new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease. If you have a bone marrow failure disease, you may want to consider taking part in a clinical trial, also called a research study.
