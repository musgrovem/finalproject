title: Aplastic Anemia: Types
---



<p>Doctors classify acquired aplastic anemia into three types, based largely on the patient's neutrophil count. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that fight bacterial infections.</p>


<h3>Types of Acquired Aplastic Anemia</h3>
 
	<h4>Moderate Aplastic Anemia (MAA)</h4>
		<p>If you have moderate aplastic anemia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You may have low blood cells counts, but not as low as with severe aplastic anemia.</li> 
				<li>You may have few or no symptoms.</li>
				<li>Your doctor may not recommend treatment. Instead, your doctor may just keep an eye on your blood counts.</li> 
				<li>Your condition may stay the same for many years.</li> 
			</ul>

	<h4>Severe aplastic Anemia (SAA)</h4>
		<p>If you have severe aplastic anemia, at least two of the following are true:</p> 
			<li>Your neutrophil count is less than 500 cells per microliter.</li>
			<li>Your reticulocyte (young red blood cell) count is less than 20,000 per microliter.</li>
			<li>Your platelet count is less than 20,000 per microliter.</li>


	<h4>Very Severe Aplastic Anemia (VSAA)</h4>
		<p>If you have very severe aplastic anemia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your neutrophil count is less than 200 per microliter.</li>
				<li>Your blood counts are otherwise like those of someone with severe aplastic anemia.</li>
