<p>More drugs are available to treat bone marrow failure disease than ever before. Researchers constantly look for ways to enhance drugs already on the market and develop new ones with fewer side effects. Some drugs treat only one type of the disease, while others may be used to treat more than one type. Check with your doctor to find out which drugs are right for you and why.</p>



	<h3><strong>Alemtuzumab</strong></h3>
	
	<p>Brand name:  Campath</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia</p>
	<p>A monocolonal antibody - a medicine that is engineered to look for a specific substance in the body. Alemtuzumab attaches to and kills white blood cells called lymphocytes. In certain types of aplastic anemia, lymphocytes are responsible for attacking the bone marrow stem cells. Alemtuzumab is in clinical trials for treating aplastic anemia. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating certain types of leukemia and is helpful in treating other conditions that require immunosuppressive therapy.</p>
 	
	<h3><strong>Amifostine</strong></h3>

	<p>Brand name:  Ethyol</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</p>
	<p>A cytoprotective agent or chemoprotectant. This drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use during cancer therapy to protect the body's normal cells. Amifostine is being studied in clinical trials, as a single agent or in combination with other medicines, for treating myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>

	<h3><strong>Antithymocyte Globulin</strong></h3>

	<p>Brand name:  ATG, Atgam, Thymoglobulin</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)</p>
	<p>ATG is an immunosuppressant, a drug that lowers the body's immune response. It is typically used with cyclosporine as the first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IS) to treat patients with acquired aplastic anemia. In some cases it is used as a treatment for patients with MDS and PNH.</p>

	<h3><strong>Arsenic Trioxide</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Trisenox, ATO</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</p>
	<p>An antineoplastic agent, this medicine works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.</p>

	<h3><strong>Azacitidine</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  5-azacytidine, Vidaza</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</p>
	<p>A demethylating agent, this medicine interacts with DNA to restore normal growth of blood cells in the bone marrow.</p>

	<h3><strong>Cyclophosphamide</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Cytoxan</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia</p>
	<p>An alkylating agent, a class of chemotherapy drugs which interfers with the growth of diseased cells. Cyclophosphamide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating certain diseases. It is still an investigational therapy, in combination with other medications, for treating aplastic anemia and other forms of bone marrow failure.</p>

	<h3><strong>Cyclosporine</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Neoral, Sandimmune
	Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
	<p>An immunosuppressant, this drug that lowers the body's immune response.</p>

	<h3><strong>Daclizumab</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Zenapax
	<p>An immunosuppressant, this drug lowers the body's immune response.</p>
	
	<h3><strong>Darbepoetin Alfa</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Aranesp
	Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia
	<p>A growth factor (cytokine), it is a man-made version of a naturally occurring substance in the body, called erythropoietin, that encourages the bone marrow to make more red blood cells.</p>

	<h3><strong>Decitabine</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Dacogen</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</p>
	<p>A demethylating agent, this drug interacts with DNA to restore normal growth of blood cells in the bone marrow.</p>

	<h3><strong>Deferasirox</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Exjade</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)</p>
	<p>An iron chelator, this drug is used to remove excess iron from the body.</p>

	<h3><strong>Deferiprone</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Ferriprox
	An iron chelator, this drug is used to remove excess iron from the body. Iron overload (too much iron in the body) can occur in patients who get lots of red blood cell transfusions.

	<h3><strong>Eculizumab</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Soliris
	Bone Marrow Diseases:  paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
	A drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

	<h3><strong>Eltrombopag</strong></h3>
	Brand name:  Promacta ®
	Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia
	Eltrombopag (Promacta ®) is used to increase the number of platelets (cells that help blood clot) and to decrease the risk of bleeding. It is a man-made platelet growth factor that signals your bone marrow to make more platelets. Eltrombopag was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 to treat aplastic anemia. It comes as a tablet and as a powder for oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.

	<h3><strong>Epoetin Alfa</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Epogen, Procrit</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  aplastic anemia</p>
	A man-made version of a naturally occurring substance in the body (erythropoietin) that encourages the bone marrow to make more red blood cells.</p>

	<h3><strong>Filgrastim</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  G-CSF, Neupogen</p>
	<p>A man-made version of a naturally occurring substance in the body that promotes white blood cell growth in the bone marrow.</p>

	<h3><strong>Fludarabine</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Fludara</p>
	<p>An antineoplastic agent, this medicine works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.</p>

	<h3><strong>Lenalidomide</strong></h3>
	<p>Brand name:  Revlimid</p>
	<p>Bone Marrow Diseases:  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</p>
	<p>An immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic agent, this drug slows the growth of blood vessels feeding abnormal cells and kills abnormal cells in the bone marrow.</p>
	
	<h3><strong>Mycophenolate Mofetil</strong></h3>
